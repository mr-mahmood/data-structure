# Data Structures in Python

### This repository features Python implementations of essential data structures, providing clear and concise examples of their operations, advantages, and practical applications. Whether you're learning data structures or preparing for coding interviews, this resource is designed to help you master the fundamentals.

## Contents
### Linear Data Structures
1. **Linked Lists**
   - Custom implementation of Singly and Doubly Linked Lists using Python classes.

2. **Stacks**
   - Implemented using `Python lists`.
   - Operations: `push`, `pop`, and others.

3. **Queues**
   - Implemented using `Python lists`.
   - Includes Circular Queues and Priority Queues.

### Non-Linear Data Structures
1. **Trees**
   - Python-based implementation of Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, and AVL Trees.
   - Includes traversal techniques like In-order, Pre-order, and Post-order.

2. **Graphs**
   - Representation using adjacency lists and matrices.
   - Algorithms for graph traversal: BFS and DFS.

### Hashing
- Python dictionaries and custom hash table implementations.
- Examples of collision handling using chaining and open addressing.

### Other Structures
- **Heaps**
  - Min-Heap and Max-Heap implementation using `my previous implementation`.
- **Tries**
  - Efficient string searching and prefix matching.

## Applications
Data structures implemented in this repository are crucial for solving problems like:
- Efficient searching and sorting.
- Pathfinding algorithms (e.g., Dijkstraâ€™s and A*).
- Data compression and encryption.
- Managing hierarchical data and file systems.

## Usage
Each data structure is organized into separate Python files with well-commented code and test cases. You can clone this repository and explore or modify the code to suit your needs.

## Contribution
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to enhance the implementations or add new data structures, feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit a pull request.
