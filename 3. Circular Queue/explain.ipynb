    "# Understanding Circular Queue Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Circular Queue?\n",
    "A **circular queue** is a linear data structure that follows the **First In, First Out (FIFO)** principle but connects the last position back to the first position to form a circle. This structure efficiently utilizes memory by reusing vacant spaces created by dequeue operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Characteristics of a Circular Queue\n",
    "1. **Circular Behavior:** The last position is connected to the first, forming a circle.\n",
    "2. **Fixed Size:** It has a fixed maximum size defined during initialization.\n",
    "3. **Pointers:**\n",
    "   - **Front Pointer:** Tracks the position of the first element.\n",
    "   - **Rear Pointer:** Tracks the position where the next element will be inserted.\n",
    "4. **Efficient Memory Usage:** Avoids wastage of space that occurs in a simple queue when elements are dequeued.\n",
    "5. **Operations:**\n",
    "   - **Enqueue:** Adds an element to the rear of the queue.\n",
    "   - **Dequeue:** Removes an element from the front of the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visual Representation\n",
    "Below is an illustration of how a circular queue works:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial State\n",
    "```\n",
    "[ _ , _ , _ , _ , _ ]\n",
    "Front -> -1, Rear -> -1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Enqueue Operations\n",
    "Adding elements (e.g., 10, 20, 30):\n",
    "```\n",
    "Enqueue(10)\n",
    "[ 10 , _ , _ , _ , _ ]\n",
    "Front -> 0, Rear -> 0\n",
    "\n",
    "Enqueue(20)\n",
    "[ 10 , 20 , _ , _ , _ ]\n",
    "Front -> 0, Rear -> 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Enqueue(30)\n",
    "[ 10 , 20 , 30 , _ , _ ]\n",
    "Front -> 0, Rear -> 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dequeue Operations\n",
    "Removing elements:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Dequeue()\n",
    "[ _ , 20 , 30 , _ , _ ]\n",
    "Front -> 1, Rear -> 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Dequeue()\n",
    "[ _ , _ , 30 , _ , _ ]\n",
    "Front -> 2, Rear -> 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Circular Behavior\n",
    "Adding more elements when the rear reaches the end of the queue:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Enqueue(40)\n",
    "[ _ , _ , 30 , 40 , _ ]\n",
    "Front -> 2, Rear -> 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Enqueue(50)\n",
    "[ _ , _ , 30 , 40 , 50 ]\n",
    "Front -> 2, Rear -> 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Enqueue(60)\n",
    "[ 60 , _ , 30 , 40 , 50 ]\n",
    "Front -> 2, Rear -> 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-World Examples\n",
    "1. **CPU Scheduling:** Tasks are processed in a circular queue.\n",
    "2. **Traffic Systems:** Vehicles at roundabouts follow circular queue behavior.\n",
    "3. **Buffer Management:** Data streaming uses circular queues to manage buffer storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "Circular queues optimize memory usage and are an essential data structure in scenarios requiring efficient resource management. Understanding their working and implementation is crucial for solving problems related to queuing and scheduling systems.\n",
