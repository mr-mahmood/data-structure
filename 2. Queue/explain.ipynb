    "# Understanding Queue Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Queue?\n",
    "A **queue** is a linear data structure that follows the **First In, First Out (FIFO)** principle. This means that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed, similar to a real-world queue, like waiting in line at a ticket counter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Characteristics of a Queue\n",
    "1. **FIFO (First In, First Out):** Elements are added at one end (the rear) and removed from the other end (the front).\n",
    "2. **Linear Structure:** The elements are arranged sequentially.\n",
    "3. **Operations:**\n",
    "   - **Enqueue:** Adding an element to the rear of the queue.\n",
    "   - **Dequeue:** Removing an element from the front of the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visual Representation\n",
    "Below is an illustration of a queue:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Initial State\n",
    "```\n",
    "Front -> [] <- Rear\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Enqueue Operations\n",
    "Adding elements (e.g., 10, 20, 30) to the queue:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Enqueue(10)\n",
    "Front -> [10] <- Rear\n",
    "\n",
    "Enqueue(20)\n",
    "Front -> [10, 20] <- Rear\n",
    "\n",
    "Enqueue(30)\n",
    "Front -> [10, 20, 30] <- Rear\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dequeue Operations\n",
    "Removing elements from the front of the queue:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Dequeue()\n",
    "Front -> [20, 30] <- Rear\n",
    "\n",
    "Dequeue()\n",
    "Front -> [30] <- Rear\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Queues\n",
    "1. **Simple Queue:** Operates strictly on FIFO.\n",
    "2. **Circular Queue:** The last position is connected to the first, making it circular.\n",
    "3. **Priority Queue:** Elements are dequeued based on priority, not just order.\n",
    "4. **Deque (Double-Ended Queue):** Elements can be added or removed from both ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-World Examples\n",
    "1. **Printer Queue:** Print jobs are processed in the order they are received.\n",
    "2. **Call Center Systems:** Customers are attended to based on when they joined the queue.\n",
    "3. **Task Scheduling:** Tasks are executed in the order they are added.\n"
