    "# Linked Lists: A Simple Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "A linked list is a way to store data where each piece of data (\"node\") is connected to the next one, like links in a chain.  \n",
    "Unlike arrays, nodes in a linked list don’t need to be stored next to each other in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧩 Basic Structure\n",
    "Each **node** has two parts:\n",
    "- **Data**: The value you want to store (e.g., a number, text).\n",
    "- **Next**: A pointer/reference to the next node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of 3 nodes:  \n",
    "`[5] → [10] → [15] → null`  \n",
    "Here, `5` is the head (start), and `15` is the tail (end). The last node points to `null`.\n",

    "## 🔄 Types of Linked Lists\n",
    "### 1. Singly Linked List\n",
    "- Each node points **only to the next node**.  \n",
    "- You can only move forward (head → tail).  \n",
    "- Example: `[A] → [B] → [C] → null`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Doubly Linked List\n",
    "- Each node points to **both next and previous nodes**.  \n",
    "- You can move forward or backward.  \n",
    "- Example: `[A] ⇄ [B] ⇄ [C] → null`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Circular Linked List\n",
    "- The **last node points back to the head**, forming a loop.  \n",
    "- Example: `[X] → [Y] → [Z] → [X]`\n",

    "## 🔑 Key Operations (With Plain-English Steps)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Insertion\n",
    "- **At the beginning**:  \n",
    "  1. Create a new node.  \n",
    "  2. Point its `next` to the current head.  \n",
    "  3. Update the head to this new node.  \n",
    "  *Time: O(1)*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **At the end**:  \n",
    "  1. Traverse to the last node.  \n",
    "  2. Point the last node’s `next` to the new node.  \n",
    "  *Time: O(n)*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Deletion\n",
    "- **Remove a node**:  \n",
    "  1. Find the node you want to delete.  \n",
    "  2. Update the previous node’s `next` to skip the target node.  \n",
    "  *Time: O(n)*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Traversal\n",
    "- Start at the head, follow `next` pointers until you reach `null`.  \n",
    "- *Time: O(n)*\n",

    "|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n",
    "| Easy to add/remove items (no shifting)    | Can’t jump directly to a node (e.g., no `list[3]`) |\n",
    "| Grows/shrinks as needed (flexible size)   | Uses extra memory for pointers        |\n",
    "| No wasted memory (allocate as you go)     | Slightly harder to code than arrays   |\n",

    "1. **Music playlists**: Songs are linked to the next/previous track.  \n",
    "2. **Undo/Redo** in apps: Doubly linked lists track changes.  \n",
    "3. **File systems**: Manage files in non-contiguous disk blocks.  \n",
    "4. **GPS navigation**: Steps in a route can be linked sequentially.\n"
